## Literature Review

The academic papers and articles used to guide our analysis are detailed below.

In the paper *Why Is There More Crime in Cities?*, economist Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote assert that the primary reasons for increased crime in larger cities are lower probabilities of arrest and recognition and the increased prevalence of female-headed households.  These findings impacted our choice of model specification in two ways.  First, we considered variables that impact the cost and benefits of crime (i.e. in the Glaeser and Sacerdote example, lower likelihood of arrests, lowers the cost of crime, which leads to an increase in crime).  Second, we included predictors related to the level female presence or lack of male presence in households.

Research done by Dan Ariely, an economist and psychologist at Duke University, also informed our model specifications. Ariely has analyzed the rationality of human decisions, particularly in relation to performing acts that consider social norms.  His findings broadly state that humans are influenced by many intangible phenomena that are outside of conventional cost/benefit analysis.  He believes that one specifically strong motivator is the ?herd? mentality ? therefore, we tried to use predictors that capture agglomerations of potential criminals or, in more general terms, non-linearity (such as using the square of proportion of the population that are males and aged 16-19).

The last significant piece of academic work is John Donohue and Steven Levitt?s paper on the impact of legalizing abortion on crime.  The paper posits that there is a strong, causal link between lowering the cost of abortion and crime as it results in fewer marginalized children.  With this information in mind, we considered variables in the ACS that relate to the level of children living in poor household/family environments.

Also, articles that detailed the most recent release of the FBI UCR statistics from The Atlantic and 538 provided a general overview of American crime trends and characteristics.
