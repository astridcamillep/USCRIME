    "As you noticed, we worked with two different datasets (though we commented one out). Both datasets contain both the FBI crime data and census data merged on the Metropolitan Statistical area level (MSA). Our baseline model (linear regression) uses the typical census data (MSA demographics, population, employment, level of education, etc) to predict murder rate, while our enhanced models (Random Forest, Adaboost, OLS) includes more variables such the number of police available in the MSA, the number of mental health workers, the average salary per hour for police and that of mental health workers. We also attempted to include gun ownership/sales for each MSA, but we couldn't find the right data. We believe that adding these variables to the census data should improve our model performance. "

    "the data explains 48% of the variance in the dependent variable. From the residuals plot, we can also see that this is the best our linear regression can do: the residuals are relatively stochastic. Our next step is to use more advanced models, specifically, tree based models. These models are known to work well with high dimensional data with a mix of categorical and continuous variables. These models also allow us to tune different parameters (number of estimators, etc) to maximize the performance."
